# Python Style Guidelines
## General Style
1. follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
2. use [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) for automatic formatting

## Docstrings
1. use [numpy's docstring conventions](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
2. prefer making docstrings for private functions/classes, even though they aren't required by pep8.
